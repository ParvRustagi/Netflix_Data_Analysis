# Netflix_Data_Analysis
Using a given CSV dataset, I analyzed Netflix's data. It contains 4 types of analysis. 

In the 1st one, there is a donut chart that shows the difference
between number of TV shows and Movies.

In the 2nd one, there is a pie chart that shows the Percentage count of different types
of ratings.

In the 3rd one, there is a bar graph that shows the top 10 countries (including the entries
where nothing is specified) where most content is added.

In the 4th one, there is a stacked bar graph which contains 3 types of sentiments: Positive, Neutral and Negative.
These sentiments are classified according to the description of the content provided in the dataset.
The total number of each sentiment of a content released after 2010 is considered.
